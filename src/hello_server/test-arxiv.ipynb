And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced \"critical point\"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.

All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools.

Therefore, it is important to know the noise levels in order to cautiously demonstrate the quantum computational advantage or realize certain tasks. Based on those statistical benchmark methods such as the correlators and the clouds, which are initially proposed to discriminate boson sampling and other mockups, we quantificationally evaluate noises of photon partial distinguishability and photon loss compensated by dark counts. This is feasible owing to the fact that the output distribution unbalances are suppressed by noises, which are actually results of multi-photon interferences. This is why the evaluation performance is better when high order correlators or corresponding clouds are employed. Our results indicate that the statistical benchmark methods can also work in the task of evaluating noises of boson sampling.',\n",

Here, we propose an integrated photonic device where a transmon qubit capacitively couples to a microwave cross-resonator, and the setup is employed for sensing of time reversal broken order in materials. In this sensing scheme, the transmon qubit plays a dual role as both a control element and a passive detector, while the photonic cross-resonator serves as the host for the sample, enabling a contact-free spectroscopic method suitable for studying materials where reliable electrical contacts are challenging to obtain, e.g., in van der Waal 2D heterostructures. We show that by tuning the coupling strength and phase between the transmon and the cross-resonator, the system allows selective control over the interaction dynamics and leads to a highly sensitive detection method that can be compactly understood in terms of evolution of excited state population and quantum metric of the resonator-transmon hybrid state. This architecture has the potential to host a wide range of quantum phenomena that can be precisely encoded in the dynamics of the transmon qubit and, in this way, potentially allows access to elusive aspects of correlated materials.',\n",

A promising candidate recently proposed is through randomly generated peaked circuits. In this work, we study an explicit construction for random peaked circuits: first selecting a random circuit $C$ of polynomial size, which forms a $k$-design. Subsequently, a second random circuit $C'$ is chosen from the same architecture, subject to a postselection criterion: $C'$ must exhibit a high overlap with $C$ in one of their rows. Utilizing unitary design properties, we demonstrate that the circuits generated by this method are non-trivial; specifically, $C'$ is provably far from $C^\\\\dagger$. Indeed, with overwhelmingly high probability, a random peaked circuit generated this way is non-compressible and is of circuit complexity $\\\\tilde \\\\Omega(nk)$. This resolves an open problem posed by Aaronson in 2022. Secondly, we analytically establish that estimating the peakedness of a random peaked circuit to within a $2^{-\\\\text{poly}(n)}$ additive error, is average-case \\\\#P-hard. When the additive error is relaxed to $1/\\\\text{poly}(n)$, we note that the worst-case scenario for this problem is BQP-complete. Under widely accepted assumptions on random quantum circuits, we identify a regime where no classical polynomial-time sequential simulator attains inverse-polynomial additive accuracy on the peak on a non-negligible fraction of instances. Thirdly, we study using peaked circuits as a practical attempt for a verifiable quantum advantage protocol. While the postselection method for generating peaked circuits could be costly, we demonstrate that numerical search for $C'$ with randomized initialization successfully returns a random peaked circuit, achieving the properties as theoretically predicted.\",\n",

Thus, the circuits of DBAC are independent of the input state, enabling the extension of algorithmic cooling from targeting entropy to quantum coherence without resorting to measurements.

As experimental advances enable the realization of large-scale graph states, efficient fidelity estimation methods are crucial for assessing their robustness against noise. However, calculations of exact fidelity become intractable for large systems due to the exponential growth in the number of stabilizers. In this work, we show that the fidelity between any ideal graph state and its noisy counterpart under IID Pauli noise can be mapped to the partition function of a classical spin system, enabling efficient computation via statistical mechanical techniques, including transfer matrix methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Using this approach, we analyze the fidelity for regular graph states under depolarizing noise and uncover the emergence of phase transitions in fidelity between the pure-state regime and the noise-dominated regime governed by both the connectivity (degree) and spatial dimensionality of the graph state. Specifically, in 2D, phase transitions occur only when the degree satisfies $d\\\\ge 6$, while in 3D they already appear at $d\\\\ge 5$. However, for graph states with excessively high degree, such as fully connected graphs, the phase transition disappears, suggesting that extreme connectivity suppresses critical behavior. These findings reveal that robustness of graph states against noise is determined by their connectivity and spatial dimensionality. Graph states with lower degree and/or dimensionality, which exhibit a smooth crossover rather than a sharp transition, demonstrate greater robustness, while highly connected or higher-dimensional graph states are more fragile. Extreme connectivity, as the fully connected graph state possesses, restores robustness.',\n",

The constant-depth quantum circuits $\\\\mathbf{QAC}^0$, a quantum counterpart of $\\\\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits, are the polynomial-size and constant-depth quantum circuits composed of only single-qubit unitaries and polynomial-size generalized Toffoli gates. The computational power of $\\\\mathbf{QAC}^0$ has been extensively investigated in recent years. In this paper, we are concerned with $\\\\mathbf{QLC}^0$ circuits, which are linear-size $\\\\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits, a quantum counterpart of $\\\\mathbf{LC}^0$.\\n  * We show that depth-$d$ $\\\\mathbf{QAC}^0$ circuits working on $n$ input qubits and $a$ ancilla qubits have approximate degree at most $\\\\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-2^{-d}})$, improving the $\\\\tilde{O}((n+a)^{1-3^{-d}})$ degree upper bound of previous works.

It entails a hierarchy of probabilistic models, with probabilities $p_k=g^k(p)$, where $g$ is the restriction of $g_\\\\mathbb{R}$ to the interval $[0,1]$, $g^k$ is the $k$th iterate of $g$, and $k$ is an arbitrary integer (positive, negative, or zero; $g^0(x)=x$). The relation between $p$ and $g^k(p)$, $k>0$, is analogous to the one between probability and neural activation function. For \\\\mbox{$k\\\\ll -1$}, $g^k(p)$ is essentially white noise (all processes are equally probable). The choice of $k=0$ is physically as arbitrary as the choice of origin of a line in space, hence what we regard as experimental binary probabilities, $p_{\\\\rm exp}$, can be given by any $k$, $p_{\\\\rm exp}=g^k(p)$. Quantum binary probabilities are defined by $g(p)=\\\\sin^2\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}p$. With this concrete form of $g$, one finds that any two neighboring levels of the hierarchy are related to each other in a quantum--subquantum relation. In this sense, any model in the hierarchy is probabilistically quantum in appropriate arithmetic and calculus. And the other way around: any model is subquantum in appropriate arithmetic and calculus. Probabilities involving more than two events are constructed by means of trees of binary conditional probabilities. We discuss from this perspective singlet-state probabilities and Bell inequalities. We find that singlet state probabilities involve simultaneously three levels of the hierarchy: quantum, hidden, and macroscopic. As a by-product of the analysis, we discover a new (arithmetic) interpretation of the Fubini--Study geodesic distance.',\n",

For exact synthesis of a target unitary, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that linearly handles global-phase equivalence and uses explicit parallel scheduling variables to certify depth-optimal solutions for small-to-medium circuits. Domain-specific valid constraints, including identity ordering, commuting-gate pruning, short-sequence redundancy cuts, and Hermitian-conjugate linkages, significantly accelerate branch-and-bound, yielding speedups up to 43x on standard benchmarks. The framework supports hardware-aware objectives, enabling fault-tolerant (e.g. T-count) and NISQ-era (e.g. entangling gates) devices. For approximate synthesis, we propose 3 objectives: (i) exact, but non-convex, phase-invariant fidelity maximization; (ii) a linear surrogate that maximizes the real trace overlap, yielding a tight lower bound to fidelity; and (iii) a convex quadratic function that minimizes the circuit's Frobenius error.\\n  To scale beyond exact MILP, we propose a novel rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) that rolls primarily in time, caps the active-qubits, and enforces per-qubit closure while globally optimizing windowed segments. This preserves local context, reduces the Hilbert-space dimension, and enables iterative improvements without ancillas. On a 142-gate seed circuit, RHO yields 116 gates, an 18.3% reduction from the seed, while avoiding the trade-off between myopic passes and long run times. Empirically, our exact compilation framework achieves certified depth-optimal circuits on standard targets, high-fidelity Fibonacci-anyon weaves, and a 36% gate-count reduction on multi-body parity circuits. All methods are in the open-source QuantumCircuitOpt, providing a single framework that bridges exact certification and scalable synthesis.\",\n",

In this work we investigate the impact of the optical pulse shape and duration on the accuracy of this method. We find that Gaussian temporal pulse shapes yield cleaner arrival-time histograms, and thus more accurate PNR, compared to bandpass-filtered pulses of equal bandwidth. For low system jitter and an optical pulse duration comparable to the other jitter contributions, photon numbers can be discriminated in our system with a commercial SNSPD. At 60 ps optical pulse duration, photon-number discrimination is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of using the correct arrival-time histogram model when analyzing photon-number assignment. Using exponentially-modified Gaussian (EMG) distributions, instead of the commonly used Gaussian distributions, we can more accurately determine photon-number misidentification probabilities.

On the flip side, while classical key exchange can be achieved non-interactively (with two simultaneous messages between Alice and Bob), no non-interactive protocol is known that provides everlasting security, even using quantum information.\\n  In this work, we make progress on this problem. Our main technical contribution is a computational variant of the celebrated monogamy of entanglement game, where the secret is only computationally hidden from the players, rather than information-theoretically. In these settings, we prove a negligible bound on the maximal winning probability over all strategies. As a direct application, we obtain a non-interactive (simultaneous message) QKD protocol from any post-quantum classical non-interactive key exchange, which satisfies everlastingly secure assuming Alice and Bob agree on the same key. The protocol only uses EPR pairs and standard and Hadamard basis measurements, making it suitable for near-term quantum hardware. We also propose how to convert this protocol into a two-round protocol that satisfies the standard notion of everlasting security.\\n  Finally, we prove a no-go theorem which establishes that (in contrast to the case of ordinary multi-round QKD) entanglement is necessary for non-interactive QKD, i.e., the messages sent by Alice and Bob cannot both be unentangled with their respective quantum memories if the protocol is to be everlastingly secure.',\n",

However, the substantial overhead of current MSD protocols remains a major obstacle to scalable implementations. We propose a general framework for pre-distillation, based on composite pulse sequences that suppress systematic errors in the generation of magic states. Unlike typical composite designs that target simple gates such as $X$, $Z$, or Hadamard, our schemes directly implement the non-Clifford $\\\\mathcal{T}$ gate with enhanced robustness. We develop composite sequences tailored to the dominant control imperfections in superconducting, trapped-ion, neutral-atom, and integrated photonic platforms. To quantify improvement in the implementation, we introduce an operationally motivated fidelity measure specifically tailored to the $\\\\mathcal{T}$ gate: the T-magic error, which captures the gate's effectiveness in preparing high-fidelity magic states. We further show that the error in the channel arising from the injection of faulty magic states scales linearly with the leading-order error of the states.

By addressing each of the NV hyperfine transitions individually, triple-tone microwave (MW) control can mitigate this sensitivity loss. Here, we experimentally and theoretically investigate the regimes in which triple-tone excitation offers an advantage over standard single-tone MW control for two DC magnetometry protocols: pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and Ramsey interferometry. We validate a master equation model of the NV dynamics against ensemble NV measurements, and use the model to explore triple-tone vs single-tone sensitivity for different MW powers and NV dephasing rates. For pulsed ODMR, triple-tone driving improves sensitivity by up to a factor of three in the low-dephasing regime, with diminishing gains when dephasing rates approach the hyperfine splitting. In contrast, for Ramsey interferometry, triple-tone excitation only improves sensitivity if MW power is limited.

While entanglement typically builds over time when evolving a quantum system initialized in a product state, freezing that information at any given instant requires quenching to a Hamiltonian with the time-evolved state as an eigenstate, a concept we realize via an Emergent Hamiltonian framework. While the Emergent Hamiltonian is generically non-local and may lack a closed form, we show examples where it is exact and local, thereby enabling, in principle, indefinite state storage limited only by experimental imperfections. Unlike other phenomena, such as many-body localization, our method preserves both local and global properties of the quantum state. In some of our examples, we demonstrate that this protocol can be used to store maximally entangled multi-qubit states, such as tensor products of Bell states, or fragile, globally distributed entangled states, in the form of GHZ states, which are often challenging to initialize in actual devices.',\n",

Datasets associated with credit default prediction often exhibit temporal correlations and high dimensionality.

A single fracton has a vanishing Hamiltonian, and thus its spectrum is entirely composed of zero modes. For the two-body problem, the Hamiltonian is perfectly described by Sturm--Liouville (SL) theory. The effective two-body Hamiltonian is an SL operator on $(-1,1)$ whose spectral type is set by the edge behavior of the pair inertia function $K(x)\\\\sim \\\\lvert x -x_\\\\mathrm{edge} \\\\rvert^{\\\\theta}$. We identify a sharp transition at $\\\\theta=2$: for $\\\\theta<2$ the spectrum is discrete and wavepackets reflect from the edges, whereas for $\\\\theta>2$ the spectrum is continuous and wavepackets slow down and, dominantly, squeeze into asymptotically narrow regions at the edges. For three particles, the differential operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian is piecewise defined, requiring several \"matching conditions\" which cannot be analyzed as easily. We proceed with a lattice regularization that preserves dipole conservation, and implicitly selects a particular continuum Hamiltonian that we analyze numerically. We find a spectral transition in the three-body spectrum, and find evidence for quantum analogs of fracton attractors in both eigenstates and in the time evolution of wavepackets.

For a nonzero $z$-component of the unit vector, there is a difference of $1-3$ orders of magnitude in the number density of spin-up and spin-down particles induced by angular momentum transfer in multiphoton absorption. Moreover, as the electric field strength increases and/or the field frequency decreases, the asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down particle number density decreases rapidly.

We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve detection efficiencies >90% for a wide range of ion species and substrate combination through selection of the implantation parameters. Furthermore, detection efficiencies of 100% are found for the doping of Sb clusters which is of direct relevance for the future fabrication of quantum devices.',\n",

       "  'summary': \"arXiv:2510.01063v1 Announce Type: cross \\nAbstract: Coxeter pointed out that a number of polytopes can be projected orthogonally into two dimensions in such a way that their vertices lie on a number of concentric regular triacontagons (or 30-gons). Among them are the 600-cell and 120-cell in four dimensions and Gosset's polytope in eight dimensions. We show how these projections can be modified into Kochen-Secker diagrams from which parity proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem are easily extracted. Our construction trivially yields parity proofs of fifteen bases for all theree polytopes and also allows many other proofs of the same type to be constructed for two of them. The defining feature of these proofs is that they have a fifteen-fold symmetry about the center of the Kochen-Specker diagram and thus involve both rays and bases that are multiples of fifteen. Any proof of this type can be written as a word made up of an odd number of distinct letters, each representing an orbit of fifteen bases. Knowing a word makes it possible to write down all the features of the associated proof without first having to recover its bases. A comparison is made with earlier approaches that have been used to obtain parity proofs in these polytopes, and two questions related to possible applications of these polytopes are raised.\",\n",
